Avoidance can be used when we know the number of resources in advance. 
Recovery via killing can be used when we know that it is safe to kill the process and other processes don't depend on the killed process
Recovery via preemption is good then we sure that process will preempt resources in a safe way
Prevention can be used when we sure that no of this one holds: mutual exclusion, hold and wait, no preemption, circular wait.
